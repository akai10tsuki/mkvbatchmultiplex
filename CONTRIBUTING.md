We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy
and transparent as possible, whether it\'s:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

# The Project is Develop with Github

Github is used to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as
well as accept pull requests.

# [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) is used, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase
([Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) is used). Pull requests are welcome:


1. Fork the repo and create your branch from [master]{.title-ref}.
2. If you\'ve added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you\'ve changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Submit test folder listing with files and files description to
   replicate tests.
6. Make sure your code lints ([pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)).
7. Code is formatted using [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

# Any contributions you make will be understood under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood
to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact
the maintainers if that\'s a concern.

# Report bugs using Github\'s [issues](https://github.com/akai10tsuki/mkvbatchmultiplex/issues) We use GitHub issues to track public bugs.

Report a bug by **opening a new issue**.

# Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Good Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Program version.
    - Copy of command line.
    - List of files in the directories used. This is better achieved
      using the **\<Check Files\>** button and including the log file
      found in HOMEDIRECTORY/.MKVBatchMultiplex/MKVBatchMultiplex.log.
    - Structure of the files, list of tracks type and order in media
      files.
    - If tracks are raw please specify the type if it cannot be
      deduced by file extension.
- Include a log file.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or
  stuff you tried that didn\'t work). Also the activate and attach log
  file.

# Use a Consistent Coding Style

The code is formatted using
[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and for linting
[pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) is used.
